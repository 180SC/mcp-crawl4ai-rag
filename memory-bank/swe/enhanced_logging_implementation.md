# Enhanced Logging Implementation for AsyncWebCrawler Debug

## Changes Made
Added debug logging statements to `src/crawl4ai_mcp.py` in the `crawl4ai_lifespan` function to track AsyncWebCrawler lifecycle:

### Logging Points Added:
1. **Before crawler creation**: `[DEBUG] Creating AsyncWebCrawler instance...`
2. **Before `__aenter__`**: `[DEBUG] About to call crawler.__aenter__()...`
3. **After `__aenter__`**: `[DEBUG] AsyncWebCrawler.__aenter__() completed successfully`
4. **Before `__aexit__`**: `[DEBUG] About to call crawler.__aexit__() for cleanup...`
5. **After `__aexit__`**: `[DEBUG] AsyncWebCrawler.__aexit__() completed successfully`

## Purpose
These logs will help identify:
- If the crawler initialization hangs
- If `__aenter__()` completes successfully
- If `__aexit__()` is called during cleanup
- If `__aexit__()` hangs or fails to complete
- The exact point where any resource leak might occur

## Testing Instructions
1. Run a crawl operation and monitor the console output
2. Look for the debug messages to track crawler lifecycle
3. If processes remain after crawling, check which debug message was the last one printed
4. This will pinpoint where in the lifecycle the issue occurs

## Expected Behavior
For a successful crawl with proper cleanup, you should see all 5 debug messages in sequence.
